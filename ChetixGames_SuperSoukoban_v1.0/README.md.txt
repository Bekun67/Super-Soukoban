LIST OF FEATURES

For this project we had to redesign the whole code that was provided to us as a template.
The map, which initially consisted of a platformer style one had to be replaced by a zenithal view. 
The tilemap could be modified from the initial code but the character movement sprites had to be completely altered, eliminating the jump and fall sprites, adding the necessary animations to walk up or down and adding the sprites of each direction that appear when pushing boxes.
We also had to add the music, there are a total of 4 tracks: in the menu, during playing and if the win or lose conditions get fullfiled. Aside from a SFX that gets implemented whenever the user enters or exits the game throught the title screen.

You start on the initial screen, then the opening cutscene gets played. When it finishes, you are greeted by the main menu screen, pressing the space bar
will get you to the level selection screen, where you can select between the different 8 levels. Choose the level that you like and press space
to open it, have fun trying to sort all the boxes :) !
